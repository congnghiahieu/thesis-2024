abstract = {This paper presents RestCT, a systematic and fully automatic approach that adopts Combinatorial Testing (CT) to test RESTful APIs. RestCT is systematic in that it covers and tests not only the interactions of a certain number of operations in RESTful APIs, but also the interactions of particular input-parameters in every single operation. This is realised by a novel two-phase test case generation approach, which first generates a constrained sequence covering array to determine the execution orders of available operations, and then applies an adaptive strategy to generate and refine several constrained covering arrays to concretise input-parameters of each operation. RestCT is also automatic in that its application relies on only a given Swagger specification of RESTful APIs. The creation of CT test models (especially, the inferring of dependency relationships in both operations and input-parameters), and the generation and execution of test cases are performed without any human intervention. Experimental results on 11 real-world RESTful APIs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RestCT. In particular, RestCT can find eight new bugs, where only one of them can be triggered by the state-of-the-art testing tool of RESTful APIs.},

ABSTRACT = {Service-oriented architecture has evolved to be the backbone for large-scale integration between different applications and platforms. This concept has led to today&rsquo;s reality of cloud services. Many of the major business platforms are providing their services to end-users and other companies as well. Companies are crafting ways to allow other businesses fast service integration and to get on board quickly in the market. REST (representational state transfer) has emerged as the standard protocol for implementing and consuming these services, which are called RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs). As the internal details of the RESTful APIs are not completely available during consumption, thorough testing has been a major challenge. Any unprecedented change in the APIs can cause the major failure of service operations, which can cause an organization to face both financial and trust losses. Research efforts have been made to alleviate testing challenges by introducing different frameworks and auto-generating unit test approaches. However, there is still a lack of an overview of the state-of-the-art in RESTful API testing. As such, the objective of this article is to identify, analyze, and synthesize the studies that have been performed related to RESTful APIs&rsquo; testing methodologies and unit test generation. With this perspective, a systematic literature review (SLR) study was conducted. In total, 16 papers were retrieved and included based on study selection criteria for in-depth analysis. This SLR discusses and categorizes different problems and solutions related to RESTful APIs&rsquo; testing and unit test generation.},

abstract = {Modern web services routinely provide REST APIs for clients to access their functionality. These APIs present unique challenges and opportunities for automated testing, driving the recent development of many techniques and tools that generate test cases for API endpoints using various strategies. Understanding how these techniques compare to one another is difficult, as they have been evaluated on different benchmarks and using different metrics. To fill this gap, we performed an empirical study aimed to understand the landscape in automated testing of REST APIs and guide future research in this area. We first identified, through a systematic selection process, a set of 10 state-of-the-art REST API testing tools that included tools developed by both researchers and practitioners. We then applied these tools to a benchmark of 20 real-world open-source RESTful services and analyzed their performance in terms of code coverage achieved and unique failures triggered. This analysis allowed us to identify strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the tools considered and of their underlying strategies, as well as implications of our findings for future research in this area.},
