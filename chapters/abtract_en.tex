With the rapid development of APIs, API testing has become a topic of particular interest in current research because APIs play a crucial role in connecting systems and applications. As technology evolves and the need for continuous integration grows, ensuring the quality and performance of APIs becomes essential.

This thesis presents an automated API testing tool that employs reinforcement learning with a reward evaluation method focused on optimizing test coverage, ensuring efficiency and comprehensiveness in the evaluation process. Through experiments on reputable testing services, the results demonstrate that the developed tool can identify 126.9 distinct errors with a 500 response code, surpassing ARAT-RL, the latest automated API testing tool, by 14 errors. In terms of speed, the presented tool generally shows better performance than ARAT-RL. Notably, at certain points, on the same request milestone, this tool outperforms with 15 more errors detected. These results prove that the tool not only improves the number of detected errors but also increases the speed of error detection, saving resources and enhancing software quality.
